<h1>About the SCL</h1>

<p>The National Senior Classical League is an organization founded to promote classical studies. We are the college-level affiliate of the <a href="http://www.njcl.org">National Junior Classical League</a>, a similarly chartered high school organization. The parent organization of both the NJCL and the NSCL is the <a href="http://www.aclclassics.org">American Classical League</a>, a professional society of Latin and Greek scholars. Our primary duties are to help the NJCL at the annual national convention and to offer scholarships to SCL members.</p>
